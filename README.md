# mnist-gan-image-generator
This code trains a GAN on the MNIST dataset to generate handwritten digit images. It includes a generator that creates images from random noise and a discriminator that distinguishes real from generated images. The GAN is trained iteratively, with generated images and model checkpoints saved periodically.
